# Web Documentary

## Description:
A web documentary project made with the goal of telling a story of an Indian emigrant, who settled down in Denmark and opened his own business
as a locksmith in the multicultural Bazar Vest in Aarhus. I was the person coding, but with help of my team mates for debugging and animations.
